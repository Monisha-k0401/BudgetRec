Every shopper looks for the best deals & discounts before buying any product. One of the major factors which lead to purchasing of any product is cost or pricing. The buyers tend to compare prices before purchasing any product. But since it is very difficult to visit each & every website for price comparison, there needs to be a solution to automate this process. The Price comparison website project proposed here gathers information on product prices from various websites & presents it to the users. The users can then choose to buy from the best options available. Even Ecommerce traders can use this price comparison website to study their competitors and form new strategies accordingly to attract new customers & stay ahead of their competitors.
